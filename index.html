    <h2>The story and development</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Batman: Arkham City is a 2011 action-adventure game developed by
      Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive
      Entertainment. Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, it is the sequel
      to the 2009 video game Batman: Arkham Asylum and the second installment in
      the Batman: Arkham series. Written by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini with
      Paul Crocker and Sefton Hill, Arkham City was inspired by the long-running
      comic book mythos. In the game's main storyline, Batman is incarcerated in
      Arkham City, a super-prison enclosing the decaying urban slums of
      fictional Gotham City. He must uncover the secret behind a sinister scheme
      orchestrated by the facility's warden, Hugo Strange. The game's leading
      characters are predominantly voiced by actors from the DC Animated
      Universe, with Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprising their roles as
      Batman and the Joker, respectively.
