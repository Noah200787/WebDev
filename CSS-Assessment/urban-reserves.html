      <h2>A Brief History of urban reserves in Canada</h2>

        The first such reserve was established in 1981 at Kylemore, Saskatchewan
        as operated by the Fishing Lake First Nation (Treaty 4). Another urban
        reserve under the Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation (Treaty 6) followed at
        Prince Albert in 1982.[2] It is argued that the first formal commercial
        urban reserve was a property of 33 acres (13 ha) established within
        Saskatoon in 1988 for the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation.[4] By 2004, the
        reserve's commercial activity grew to provide employment for 350 people
        under 37 businesses, today known as the McKnight Commercial
        Centre.[4][5] The Treaty Land Entitlement Framework Agreement (TLEFA)
        was signed on 9 September 1992[2] to settle unresolved treaty land
        claims for 28 First Nation groups in Saskatchewan. Article 9 of this
        accord provides a mechanism for First Nations groups to contract with
        municipal governments to allow designation of certain properties as
        reserves.[1][4] At least four urban reserves are also established in
        Manitoba.[3] One of these, situated north of Winnipeg under the auspices
        of the Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation (Treaty 1), includes a gas
        station and a tobacco retailer with plans to include a medical facility
        and larger operations such as automobile retail.[6]
