          <h2>Who are the Minnisota Vikings</h2>
          <p>
            The Minnesota Vikings are a professional American football team
            based in Minneapolis. They compete in the National Football League
            (NFL) as a member club of the National Football Conference (NFC)
            North division.[7] Founded in 1960 as an expansion team, the team
            began play the following year. They are named after the Vikings of
            medieval Scandinavia, reflecting the prominent Scandinavian American
            culture of Minnesota.[8] The team plays its home games at U.S. Bank
            Stadium in the Downtown East section of Minneapolis.
